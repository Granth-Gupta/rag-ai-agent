TEST 1: What are the core features of AI agents and how do they achieve autonomy?
================================================================================

RESPONSE (4264 chars, 8.89s):
Based on the provided documents, here are the core features of AI agents and how they achieve autonomy:

**Core Features of AI Agents:**

*   **Reasoning:** AI agents use logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems ("Reasoning This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems.").
*   **Acting:** They have the ability to take action or perform tasks based on decisions, pl...

TEST 2: Explain chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot learning techniques
================================================================================

RESPONSE (326 chars, 2.82s):
Chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot learning are prompting techniques used in conjunction with large language models (LLMs).

*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** This technique involves step-by-step reasoning. (Document 1)
*   **Few-shot Learning:** This involves prompt design patterns with diverse examples. (Document 1)

DOCUMENTS FOUND: True

TEST 3: How does HNSW indexing work in vector databases?
================================================================================

RESPONSE (289 chars, 2.94s):
Document 1 mentions that Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs are one of the most important techniques for similarity search on high-dimensional vectors in vector databases. It also notes that HNSW-based implementations have been among the best performers in recent benchmarks.

TEST 4: What are the best practices for RAG implementation?
================================================================================

RESPONSE (1553 chars, 2.84s):
Based on the provided documents, here are some best practices for RAG implementation:

*   **Augment the model's external knowledge base with updated information:** Instead of retraining the model, update the external knowledge base with new information (Document 1, Document 3).
*   **Convert data into LLM embeddings:** Transform the data into numerical representations (embeddings) and store them in a vector database (Document 3).
*   **Use a document retriever:** Use a document retriever to sel...

TEST 5: Describe transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
================================================================================

RESPONSE (2959 chars, 6.52s):
The transformer architecture is a neural network architecture excelling at processing sequential data. It was first described in the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" (Document 5). Transformer models are now used in NLP, computer vision, speech recognition, and time series forecasting (Document 5).

**Key aspects of the transformer architecture:**

*   **Self-Attention Mechanism:** The central feature, enabling the model to detect relationships between parts of an input sequence (Document 5...
